 * Represents an event triggered when a player's vanish effects are cleared.

 * or vanish state is removed, and any associated effects (e.g., gameplay changes
 * or visual adjustments) are reverted. For instance, when a player exits the vanish
 * mode, this event ensures that corresponding effects such as scheduler tasks or
 * visibility settings are cleared.
